A countdown, etc.

== Description ==

A countdown from www.memocalculator.com. It works on PC and mobile devices. It adjusts to any size. Very easy to use for date countdown.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== How it works ==

The widget works by pulling in the countdown from the actual
memocalculator.com site.
More specifically it pulls in an HTML file into an iframe.
